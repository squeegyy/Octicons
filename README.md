## Octicons

The github icon font Octicons for [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap)

## Examples

Bootstrap uses an &lt;i&gt; tag for all icons, but they have no case class&mdash;only a shared prefix. To use, place the following code just about anywhere:

 ```html
	<i class="icon-search"></i>
 ```
 
There are also styles available for inverted (white) icons, made ready with one extra class:

 ```html
	<i class="icon-search icon-white"></i>
 ```

## How to use
1. Copy the Octions font directory into your project.
2. Copy octicons.css into your project.
3. Open your project's octicons.css and edit the font url to ensure it points to the right place.
4. In the &lt;head&gt; of your html, reference the location to your octicons.css.
 ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css">
	
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="octicons.css">
 ```
5. Check out the examples to start using Octions!
